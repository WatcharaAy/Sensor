    Chemical sensors are are measurement devices that convert
    a chemical or physical property of a specific analyte
    into a measurable signal, whose magnitude is normally
    proportional to the concentration of the analyte

    Bio sensors are an analytical device that detects changes
    in Biological processes and converts them into
    an electrical signal. The term Biological process can be
    any biological element or material like
    enzymes, tissues, microorganisms, cells, acids, etc.
